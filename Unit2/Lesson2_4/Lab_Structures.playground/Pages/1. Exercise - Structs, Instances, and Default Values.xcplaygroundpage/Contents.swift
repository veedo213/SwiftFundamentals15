## Exercise - Structs, Instances, and Default Values
 
 Imagine you are creating an app that will monitor location. Create a `GPS` struct with two variable properties, `latitude` and `longitude`, both with default values of 0.0.
 */
struct GPS {
    var latitude: Double = 0.0
    var longitude: Double = 0.0
}
//:  Create a variable instance of `GPS` called `somePlace`. It should be initialized without supplying any arguments. Print out the latitude and longitude of `somePlace`, which should be 0.0 for both.
var somePlace = GPS()
print("Latitude: (somePlace.latitude), Longitude: (somePlace.longitude)")
// Output: Latitude: 0.0, Longitude: 0.0
//:  Change `somePlace`'s latitude to 51.514004, and the longitude to 0.125226, then print the updated values.
somePlace.latitude = 51.514004
somePlace.longitude = 0.125226
print("Latitude: (somePlace.latitude), Longitude: (somePlace.longitude)")
// Output: Latitude: 51.514004, Longitude: 0.125226
//:  Now imagine you are making a social app for sharing your favorite books. Create a `Book` struct with four variable properties: `title`, `author`, `pages`, and `price`. The default values for both `title` and `author` should be an empty string. `pages` should default to 0, and `price` should default to 0.0.
struct Book {
    var title: String = ""
    var author: String = ""
    var pages: Int = 0
    var price: Double = 0.0
}
//:  Create a variable instance of `Book` called `favoriteBook` without supplying any arguments. Print out the title of `favoriteBook`. Does it currently reflect the title of your favorite book? Probably not. Change all four properties of `favoriteBook` to reflect your favorite book. Then, using the properties of `favoriteBook`, print out facts about the book.
var favoriteBook = Book()
print("Title: (favoriteBook.title)")
// Output: Title:

// Change all four properties to your favorite book
favoriteBook.title = "To Kill a Mockingbird"
favoriteBook.author = "Harper Lee"
favoriteBook.pages = 281
favoriteBook.price = 7.99

// Print out facts about the book
print("'(favoriteBook.title)' by (favoriteBook.author) has (favoriteBook.pages) pages and costs $(favoriteBook.price).")
// Output: 'To Kill a Mockingbird' by Harper Lee has 281 pages and costs $7.99.
